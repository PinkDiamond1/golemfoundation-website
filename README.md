# Golem Foundation Website

Sources for the Golem Foundation website. Intended to be used with Jekyll to
generate static HTML. Jekyll CSS theme based on the [Qubes OS
theme](https://qubes-os.org). Thanks Qubes OS Project contributors for keeping
information free!

## Primarily git-based, not necessarily GitHub-based

While the website is currently being served via GitHub Pages service, it is by
no means GitHub.com-specific or dependent. We can migrate to a different
provider anytime. Including exposing the static version via whatever webserver,
however hosted.

With current deployment on GitHub.com, the actual repo used for the website is
`golemfoundation.github.io`, which is a clone of this repo. Mainly for
reliability reasons, this latter repo is private.

## Properties

- Zero cookies(TM)
- Static
- Suitable for redistribution independent of hosting service provider (it's just
  a human-readable collection of files, collected as a git repo)
- Support for digital signature for the site *content* (as opposed to connection
  as in TLS)
- Created using only free software
