  role: Long-term navigation
  bio: Spent nearly 20 years exploring various corners of computer systems
    technology, down to the level of actual processors and devices, trying to
    understand how these systems are supposed to work, as well as how they might
    be tricked to work contrary to the intentions of the creators. Then moved on
    to work on the defensive side for nearly another decade by founding and leading
    the Qubes OS project. More recently, after a healthy sabbatical break from
    infosec, joined Golem Project in October 2018 as Chief Strategy Officer, happy
    to dive into the new world of challenges and possibilities.
