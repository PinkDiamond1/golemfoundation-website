Welcome to Golem Foundation.

We develop and promote technologies that extend the vision of Golem and add novel applications for Golem Network Token. 

Everything we do is based on the principles of transparency and freedom, which combined with a decentralized approach to software and social interactions can truly make a positive impact on our world.

Our focus is on internal research and development but we are open to cooperation in the  wider decentralized ecosystem, including financing external teams whose goals are aligned with our agenda.
